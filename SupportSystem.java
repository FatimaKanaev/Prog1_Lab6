/**
 * This class implements a technical support system. It is the top level class 
 * in this project. The support system communicates via text input/output 
 * in the text terminal.
 * 
 * This class uses an object of class InputReader to read input from the user,
 * and an object of class Responder to generate responses. It contains a loop
 * that repeatedly reads input and generates output until the users wants to 
 * leave.

/*
 * /*
 * Question 2
 * The structure of class documentation shows which package it belongs to
 * Constructor summary: Lists available constructors
 * Method summary: List methods with short descriptions
 * Method details: detailed explanations of each method
 * Inherited methods: Methods inherited from parent classes.
 * Other classes start with the same structure.
 * 
 * Question 3
 * The first version is boolean startsWith(String prefix) and it 
 * checks if the string starts with the given prefix
 * 
 * The second version is boolean startsWith(String prefix, int toffset)
 * It verifies if the substring  starting from toffset starts with the given prefix
 * 
 * Question 4
 * There is a method which is endsWith(String suffix)
 * and its return type is type is boolean
 * 
 * Question 5
 * The method in the String class is length()
 * and it returns the number characters in a string
 * 
 * Question 6
 * I found them by using JavaDocs
 * Methods are easy to find when you know what you're looking for
 * 
 * Question 7
 * Signature of the methos: public String trim()
 * 
 * Question 10 
 * Return type is boolean
 * Question 12
 * Found in java.util package and it's used for generating random numbers
 * 
 * Question 13
 * Random rand = new Random();
 * int randomNumber = rand.nextInt(50);
 * System.out.println(randomNumber);
